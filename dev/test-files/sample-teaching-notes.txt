ACTUAL OUTCOME (optional for debrief)

[Instructor's note: You can share this after discussion or use for a follow-up class]

John Malawi decided to pursue a modified catering strategy:
- Started with a 6-month pilot program
- Limited catering to lunch delivery only (avoiding dinner peak)
- Minimum order: $250
- Used existing staff (no new hires initially)
- Invested $75K instead of $150K

Results after 12 months:
- Catering revenue: $180K (below projection but profitable)
- Operating margin: 14% (better than projected due to lower overhead)
- No negative impact on restaurant operations
- 8 regular corporate clients established
- Plans to expand with dedicated catering manager in Year 2

Key lessons:
- Pilot approach reduced risk and validated demand
- Starting small preserved optionality
- Lower investment requirement made decision easier
- Integration with existing operations worked better than anticipated
