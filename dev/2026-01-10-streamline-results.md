## Streamline Results section of Instructor Dashboard

The Courses \- Sections ("Course Sections") screen lists the sections and lets the instructor add/enable/edit/duplicate/delete sections, which is great. When you click on a section title it displays results for the section (including stats and a beautiful histogram) which is great and a carryover from the early version of this app that only had one case. Now that we have a more organized Instructor Dashboard, it seems that that section results report should instead show up under the "Results" tab "Sections" subheading. Currently that Results Sections screen displays the list of "All Sections Performance" and if you click on a section title it reverts back to that wonderful report under Courses \- Sections list but the wonderful report should be in the Results Sections tab.  
That "Results" tab is useful but could stand being reorganized.  
The Results tabs (Overview, Sections, Cases, Responses, Positions) could be consolidated into one tab with two types of result display: summary and details (as described below).  
The top of the Results screen would have the heading "Results (Analytics & Reports)" with subheading "Performance insights from completed case chats".  
Then there would be drop-down multi-selectors for "Course sections", "Cases". The selectors should include "ALL sections" "ALL cases" options at the top.  
After identifying section(s) and case(s) the instructor can select (or unselect) "Show summary statistics" and/or "Show student details".  
The summary statistics are the statistics and "Score Distribution" histogram currently showing under the "Overview" tab. If there is more than one selected section or more than one selected case, the summary statistics should show a table of performance breakdown by section/case.  
The student details is like the lists that show up in the current Results list the following details and options (fields marked with \+ are columns that can be added to the report or "x" removed from the report):

* Student (name)  
* Section  
* Case  
* Status+ (completed, started, whatever)  
* Position+ (if the case tracks positions, as reported in the "Results" "Responses" report)  
  * Initial position+  
  * Final position+ (show one or both)  
* Persona+  
* Score+ (like "3/15")  
* Hints+ (number of hints requested)  
* Helpful+ (the helpfulness score)  
* Time+  
* Actions: (icons and actions from the current results lis)  
  * view transcript (icon to view the student results in a third "student details" tab and possibly set the position as allowed in the Results \- Responses report)  
  * view evaluation (icon to view the case chat evaluation)  
  * allow re-chat (if you want to allow a re-chat) Provide any additional suggestions for making results reporting more intuitive.

It would be good to also have features current used in other Instructor Dashboard reports, such as…

1. allow sorting by any of these displayed columns  
2. indicate how many records to show (10, 20, 50, 100\)  
3. have an “Export CSV” to export the selected rows and columns

Provide any additional suggestions for making results reporting more intuitive.

Attach the plan to the end of this document for me to review.
