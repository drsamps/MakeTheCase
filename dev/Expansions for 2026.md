This app is called "ChatWithCEO" because the original version was about chatting with a CEO.
I am expanding the app to chat with other case study protagonists some being CEOs and others not CEOs.
How hard would it be to rename the app "MakeTheCase" both locally and on Github?

This app uses Supabase as the backend. It would be better if it used MySQL as the database.
I have installed MySQL server on this computer.
Configrue the app to use MySQL.
