[x] This app is called "ChatWithCEO" because the original version was about chatting with a CEO.
I am expanding the app to chat with other case study protagonists some being CEOs and others not CEOs.
How hard would it be to rename the app "MakeTheCase" both locally and on Github?

[x] This app uses Supabase as the backend. It would be better if it used MySQL as the database.
I have installed MySQL server on this computer and set up the database as "ceochat".
Configrue the app to use MySQL and this "ceochat" database.
In the .env.local file allow me to enter the mysql username and password to access that database.


[] The admin tool reports on student by course section, but otherwise could be more useful.
Please recommend some admin tool features that might be useful for setting up case chats and monitoring student progress.
