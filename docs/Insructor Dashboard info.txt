It would be nice if the app allowed the user to control-click on the "Chat with the CEO" title to automatically go to the Admin screen to login and see the Instructor Dashboard. This should be subtle, keeping the mouse pointer the same, a tooltip of simply "admin", and with clicking on the title doing nothing.
Also, the Instructor Dashboard login should have a "to Chatbot" link at the bottom that returns to the student screen.
